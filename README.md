Proffy is a platform to find teachers disposed to help students to get knowledge, and don't stop studying even in the hardest times.
In this aplication, you can find avaiable teachers in your own schedule and with the price that fit in your pocket.

## Technologies :gear:
This RESTful API have been developed with **Node.js**, **Express** and **Typescript**,  a complete and modern stack, used by great companies as Uber, Netflix, NASA, Wallmart, in many others, perfect to create applications like this one. The choosen database is  **SQLite3**, and we're using **Knex** query builder to manipulate it. In the future, this query builder should be replaced by TypeORM.

## Application :computer:
- The **Front end** application, developed with React, is in [this repo](https://github.com/NickSant/Proffy-web-client)

- The **Mobile** app will be developed soon...
